# Studio Q

Studio Q is a front-end development project where I created a website to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is not intended for real-world use or commercial purposes. It is purely for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Browse through various products on the website.
- Add and remove products to/from the cart.
- Empty the shopping cart.
- Note: This website is a practice project and does not support actual transactions.

## Usage

To run Studio Q locally on your machine, it is recommended to use Live Server to avoid cross-origin issues.
